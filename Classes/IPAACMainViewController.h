Now that we have initialized our navController and pushed our main controller view onto the stack
 we need to tell the program how to navigate between pages.  So we make two functions, one that will
 navigate to the Play IPAAC page and one that will navigate to the IPAAC Activity Sheet Studio.
 Once the functions are initialized, we can go into our IPAACMainViewController.m file and define
 what happens for each one of these methods.
